# PizzaToss
Pizza Toss iOS Game

Pizza Toss is a mobile game built using Swift and designed for the iPhone series.

The goal of this game is to score as many points as possible within the given time limit. However, there is a score cap you must reach before progessing to the next stage so you must be quick and also accurate if you wish to create a new highscore.

Playing the game is as simple as dragging the cursor icon in the general direction you wish to send your pizza, be weary as the further you progress into the game obstacles will appear, making it harder to hit the targets.
